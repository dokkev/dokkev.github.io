My name is Dong Ho Kang (DK), and I am a PhD student investiages design optimization of humanoid robots at [Human Centered Robotics Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/) in the University of Texas at Austin. I focus on bridging the gap between skill-level manipulation and robot hardware by integrating robot morphology, mechanism, and control as a single, coupled design problem.
